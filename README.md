## Hello! 👋 I'm Uriel

🎮 **Game Programmer** with a software development background.

This GitHub primarily showcases my **game development projects**, where I focus on:
- Gameplay systems
- Player mechanics
- Interactive features
- Clean, organized, and maintainable code

I mainly work with:
- **Unity (C#)**
- **Godot (GDScript)**
- 2D game development and system-oriented design

Alongside game development, I have professional experience in **software and web development**, including:
- **ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages, and Blazor**
- JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- Basic Linux server deployment using Docker

Some of my web projects are not public due to production use, but this background allows me to approach game development with a strong understanding of **software architecture, problem-solving, and engineering practices**.

📦 **Playable builds of my games are available on my itch.io profile:**  
👉 *[(Itch.io: UrieLara)](https://urielara.itch.io/)*

I'm currently focused on growing as a **game programmer**, with a strong interest in gameplay systems and interactive technologies.

## Hello! 👋 I'm Uriel ##

🎮 Game Programmer focused on developing gameplay systems and interactive experiences.

I work primarily with **Unity (C#)** and **Godot (GDScript)**, building 2D games that focus on gameplay mechanics, player systems, and clean, maintainable code. My background in engineering and software development gives me a strong foundation in logic, problem-solving, and system-oriented thinking.

I also have experience in web development using **JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ASP.NET**, and basic **Linux server deployment**, which helps me approach game development with a solid understanding of software architecture and tools.

Currently focused on growing as a **game programmer**, with a strong interest in gameplay systems and interactive technologies.

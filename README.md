## Hello! 👋 I'm Uriel ##

🎮 Aspiring Video Game Developer
I'm currently studying Video Game Development, improving my skills to bring ideas to life and create engaging interactive worlds.

💻 While I have experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ASP.NET and deployment on Linux servers for web pages, my main focus is game development.

🔍 I'm continuously learning and coding, building skills for a career in game development.

☕ ~ _A good coffee always accompanies my lines of code_ ~
